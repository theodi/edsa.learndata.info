To maximise the value that data science brings to&nbsp;a business and to introduce sustainable change, it is crucial&nbsp;to embed data science within all parts of&nbsp;the business that form your business&#39;s ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Successfully embedding data science within a business requires a data science strategy to guide your activities.

Angel investors are wealthy individuals who provide a startup with capital in return for equity or repayable debt. They typically invest their own money in the startup, as well as providing mentorship and networking opportunities. Depending on location, they may join together with other angels to form angel networks.<br /><br />The amount of seed funding a startup can gain from angel investors will differ from country to country. Although there are some European-wide networks, such as the <a href=\"http://www.eban.org/\" target=\"_blank\">European Business Angel Network</a>,&nbsp;angels tend to invest in startups from their local city, region or country. This is because they often have local networks and experience, but also due to local investment incentives (such as the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemes-apply-to-use-the-seed-enterprise-investment-scheme\">Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme</a> in the UK). You can find a list of European angel investors <a href=\"https://angel.co/europe/investors\">here</a>.</p>",

These are typically private funds which contain pooled money from investors, often including high net worth individuals, foundations, public pensions funds and corporate pension funds. This money is invested in a portfolio of startup companies, usually in a specific sector (&lsquo;vertical&rsquo;), in return for equity. VC funds provide funding so that a startup can grow and eventually have a successful &lsquo;exit&rsquo;, by being bought by another company or selling shares to the public for the first time (an initial public offering).<br /><br />There are many examples of VC funds who invest in European startups, including Lakestar, Accel Partners, Northzone and Index Ventures. There are also several VC funds who focus on startups using new data science and technology approaches, such as<a href=\"https://www.gv.com/\"> Google Ventures</a>,<a href=\"https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual\"> Bloomberg Beta</a> and<a href=\"https://www.dcvc.com/\"> Data Collective</a>.

For instance, the <a href=\"https://www.nectar.com/\">Nectar card scheme </a>collects data about consumer purchases among a variety of partners in the sector ecosystem, and provides them with offers tailored to their interests.

Actors assume that will help them gain a competitive advantage that gives them a bigger share of the market.<br /><br />An example of a closed ecosystem is the music sector, which has&nbsp;historically tried to keep everything closed. However, actors such as Youtube and Spotify have forced the industry to diversify and look for new business models as people expect to be able to access music at the click of a button. New business models include providing priority access to additional content or gig tickets for purchasing of albums and tracks.</p>",

Across many countries, there is some interaction and exchange of data between actors in the medical sector. This is often to share findings and results from&nbsp;medical trials in order to&nbsp;improve medical provisions quickly and reduce duplication in research.

Depending&nbsp;on the way that these actors interact, especially in how data and information is exchanged, ecosystems can be closed, shared or open.&nbsp;</p><p>In the future, sector ecosystems may look very different, as data science is transforming the way that sector ecosystems interact.
